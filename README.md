# Project-10-FullStack_App_React_REST-API
In this project I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Users may only be able to update or delete courses in which they are the owner. Implementing these features pushed my React skills to new heights.

This project was styled with a Saved By The Bell theme (as well as theme music), as the fictional Bayside High School. For full experience DO NOT run `npm run seed` which will remove all characters and courses.  

Users are as follows:
- Joe Smith (original database)
- Sally Jones (original database)
- Zack Morris
- Kelly Kapowski
- AC Slater
- Lisa Turtle
- Jessie Spano
- Screech Powers

All e-mail addresses and passwords are lowercase - `firstname@lastname.com` - `firstnamepassword`
